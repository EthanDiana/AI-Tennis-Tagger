# AI Automated Tagger Project

This repository is dedicated to the AI Automated Tagger project by a section of UCLA's Tennis Consulting team. The goal of this project is to develop software that automates the data tagging of tennis match videos, which is currently manually performed by the tagging team. 
This project aims to adapt existing open-source software, originally designed for professional match videos, to work with UCLA's match cameras. By automating this process, we hope to significantly reduce the time and effort required to tag matches.

This is an ongoing project, and we are actively working on developing and refining the software. While the project is still in progress, a demonstration video of the current functionality is available in this repository.
